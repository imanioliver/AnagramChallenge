Flock code challenge

Guidelines 

Please send me a fully functioning program. Write it in whatever language you feel most comfortable in. Use whatever resources you like — docs, Stack Overflow, etc. — short of straight-up having someone write them for you.

There is no official start time or time limit on this project, but please let us know when you'll have a chance to take a crack at it. As a rough guideline, we don't want you to have to spend more than about 2 hours on this.

When completed, email us the Github Repo containing the program. Remember to use lots of commits along the way! 


Anagrams

Create a function that finds two words in a text that are anagrams of another two words in that text. For example:

Happy eaters always heat their yappers.
Would yield: happy eaters and heat yappers

The function should also work on long blocks of text.

Rules:
- Treat all letters as lowercase.
- Ignore any words less than 4 characters long.
- Treat all non-alpha-numeric characters as whitespace.
- So "Surely. And they're completely right!" becomes four words: "surely  they completely right"
- Neither of the words in the first pair can be repeated in the second pair.

Please let me know if you have any questions or clarifications!
