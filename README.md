### AnagramChallenge

## Anagrams

# Create a function that finds two words in a text that are anagrams of another two words in that text. 

For example:
Happy eaters always heat their yappers.
Would yield: happy eaters and heat yappers

The function should also work on long blocks of text.

# Rules:
- Treat all letters as lowercase.
- Ignore any words less than 4 characters long.
- Treat all non-alpha-numeric characters as whitespace.
- So "Surely. And they're completely right!" becomes four words: "surely  they completely right"
- Neither of the words in the first pair can be repeated in the second pair.

Please let me know if you have any questions or clarifications!
